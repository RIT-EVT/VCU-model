% This example shows how to read in data from thermocouples using NI
% devices that support thermocouple measurements using the Session based
% interface.

%% Discover Devices that Support Thermocouples
% To discover a device that supports Thermocouples, click the name of the
% device in the list in the Command window, or access the device in the
% array returned by |daq.getDevices| command. This example uses a NI 9213
% device.   This is a 16 channel thermocouple module and is device 6 in our
% system.
devices = daq.getDevices

%% Add a Thermocouple Channel
% Create a session, and add an analog input channel with |Thermocouple|
% measurement type and change the |Rate| to four scans per second.
%
s = daq.createSession('ni');
addAnalogInputChannel(s,'cDAQ1Mod5',1, 'Thermocouple'); % TC 2
addAnalogInputChannel(s,'cDAQ1Mod5',0, 'Thermocouple'); % TC 1
addAnalogInputChannel(s,'cDAQ1Mod1',0, 'Voltage'); % Power Supply 3V3 rail
addAnalogInputChannel(s,'cDAQ1Mod1',1, 'Voltage'); % Thermistor 1 control
addAnalogInputChannel(s,'cDAQ1Mod8',0, 'Voltage'); %This is for the TMS 3.3 volt rail
addAnalogInputChannel(s,'cDAQ1Mod8',1, 'Voltage'); % TempSense1
addAnalogInputChannel(s,'cDAQ1Mod8',2, 'Voltage'); % MuxOut
s.Rate = 7.0 % Sample Rate, this was changed from 14 --Clayton Koppi
s.DurationInSeconds = 4; % Test Duration
%% Configure Channel Properties
% Many properties are configured on channels individually.  You can access
% channels through the |Channels| property, and see a list of properties
% and possible values by using the |set| command.
tc1 = s.Channels(1);
set(tc1)
tc2 = s.Channels(2);
set(tc2)
%%
% In this example, set the thermocouple type to K and units to Kelvin. Make
% sure you match the thermocouple type to your sensor configuration.
tc1.ThermocoupleType = 'K';
tc1.Units = 'Celsius';
tc2.ThermocoupleType = 'K';
tc2.Units = 'Celsius';

% Use the |startForeground| command to start the acquisition.
